<h1 align="center">React Multi-Fetch Project</h1>

<p align="center">
  A React project that demonstrates fetching data from multiple APIs using <code>fetch</code>.
</p>

## 📋 Overview

This project showcases how to fetch data from multiple APIs sequentially in a React application. It's a common scenario when you need to retrieve data from one API and then use that data to make additional API requests.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Fetch data from multiple APIs.
- 📜 Display data in a user-friendly format.
- 🔄 Sequential API requests.
- 📚 Learn how to handle asynchronous operations in React.

## 🛠️ How it Works

1. The app starts by making an initial API request to a predefined endpoint (in this case, a Game of Thrones API: 'https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/').
2. Upon receiving the data, it extracts relevant information, such as another API URL.
3. A second API request is made using the extracted URL.
4. The data from the second request (GOT books list) is displayed to the user.

## 📝 Note
This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates the concept of sequential API requests in React. You can replace the example APIs with your own data sources.
